Performed EDA on imbalanced data, including visualization, preprocessing, and Univariate/Bivariate Analysis.
Applied ML algorithms such asLogistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, SVM, Decision Tree.
Performed GridSearch to find the best set of parameters for the models , Achieved classification Recall up to 93%.
Evaluated models via F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC curves; identified Logistic Regression and SVC as superior.
